# Example R Applications for Heroku

This repository holds a number of example R applications for Heroku, which use
the [heroku-buildpack-r][buildpack] buildpack.

> R is ‘GNU S’, a freely available language and environment for statistical
> computing and graphics which provides a wide variety of statistical and
> graphical techniques: linear and nonlinear modelling, statistical tests, time
> series analysis, classification, clustering, etc. Please consult the
> [R project homepage][rhome] for further information.

You can use each example project as a template for creating your own application.
